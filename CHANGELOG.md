# RawrXD IDE v1.0.0-Stable
**"The Native Standard"**
**Release Date:** 2026-06-22  
**Build Status:** Gold Master ✅

---

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Core:** Pure Win32 + MASM x64. Zero dependencies.
* **LSP Integration:** First-class support for `clangd`, `pyright`, and `rust-analyzer`.
* **Intelligence:** Native Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P), Quick Open, and File Explorer.
* **Performance:** Optimized GDI painting pipeline with zero-flicker overlays.
* **Architecture:** "Gold Master" status—fully audit-hardened and stability-proven.

## 🛠 Fixes & Hardening (v1.0.0)

### Critical
* **Fixed:** Color-key transparency collision in Annotation Overlay (moved to RGB(1,1,1)).
  * *File:* `Win32IDE_Annotations.cpp`
  * *Issue:* Pure black `RGB(0,0,0)` conflicted with `BLACK_BRUSH`, causing entire overlay to become transparent.
  * *Solution:* Use near-black `RGB(1,1,1)` for color-key transparency.

### Medium
* **Fixed:** Flicker-free painting enforced across all overlays.
  * *Files:* `Win32IDE_PeekOverlay.cpp`, `Win32IDE_DiffView.cpp`, `Win32IDE_Tier2Cosmetics.cpp`, `Win32IDE.cpp`
  * *Pattern:* All overlay window procedures now return 1 from `WM_ERASEBKGND` to prevent default background erase.

### Low
* **Fixed:** GDI resource management in floating panels.
  * *Pattern:* Per-paint brushes now properly cleaned up with `DeleteObject()`.

## 🎯 Technical Highlights

### GDI/Painting Pipeline Hardening
- Color-key transparency uses industry-standard `RGB(1,1,1)` to avoid pure black collision
- Consistent `WM_ERASEBKGND: return 1;` pattern across all overlay windows
- Proper brush lifecycle management (create/use/delete)

### Overlay Windows Fixed
- ✅ Annotation Overlay (diagnostic annotations)
- ✅ Peek Overlay (Alt+F12 definition peek)
- ✅ Diff Panel (side-by-side diff view)
- ✅ Git Diff Panel (source control diff)
- ✅ Floating Panel (bottom panel)
- ✅ Ghost Text Overlay (inline completions)
- ✅ Agent Diff Panel (agent edit review)

## 🏆 Gold Master Verification

### Build Verification
- [x] Clean rebuild from scratch
- [x] No stale object files
- [x] All compilation units successful

### Runtime Verification
- [x] Annotation overlay renders correctly (no black box)
- [x] Peek overlay shows without flicker
- [x] Diff panels render smoothly

## 📝 Known Technical Debt (Non-Critical)

### Activity Bar Brushes
- **Location:** `Win32IDE_VSCodeUI.cpp`
- **Issue:** 3 class-level brushes (`m_actBarBackgroundBrush`, `m_actBarHoverBrush`, `m_actBarActiveBrush`) not explicitly deleted
- **Impact:** Low - OS reclaims resources on process exit
- **Planned Fix:** v1.0.1 maintenance release

### Command Palette Class Brush
- **Location:** `Win32IDE_Commands.cpp`
- **Issue:** Class background brush set via `SetClassLongPtrA` not explicitly freed
- **Impact:** Low - single brush, OS handles cleanup on class unregistration
- **Planned Fix:** v1.0.1 maintenance release

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

This release represents the culmination of extensive engineering effort to create a zero-dependency, native Win32 IDE that rivals modern web-based alternatives in features while maintaining the performance and stability that only native code can provide.

**Engineering Philosophy:**
- Zero external dependencies
- Pure Win32 API + MASM x64
- First-class LSP support
- Performance-first architecture
- Long-term maintainability
